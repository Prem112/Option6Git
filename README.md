# Introduction

This is a simple, random number guessing game.



# Deployment in GIt

1. Building infrastructure

		3. Install the git, link: https://git-scm.com/download/win
		4. Open Git bash and configure it
			1. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            2. git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
		5. Clone the git repository code "git clone https://github.com/Prem112/Option6Git.git"

# Prerequisites for Python

This file can run on both Windows and Linux operating system.

Install Python3.9.6 and git clone this repo.

Running Guess_Random_Number.py from the command line and start to play the guessing game.



## Guess_Random_Number.py 

Download::

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Prem112/Option6Git.git
```

Execution::

```
Guess_Random_Number.py
```



# Getting Started

Enter your guess for the random number generated by the code.

> Enter your guess of what the target number is:- 
>
> 

If the player entered a guess lower than the target number, it will prompt the message below. 

>Oops, Your guess was LOW.
>
>

If the player entered a guess higher than the target number, it will prompt the message below. 

>Oops, Your guess was HIGH.
>
>

The code will notify the player the number of tries left for the game after each entry. The player has a maximum of 10 tries.

>You have only left 9 Chances
>
>

If maximum number of tries has expired, it will prompt the message below. 

>Sorry, You didn't guess my number. It was [target].
>
>

If the player guessed the random number correctly. it will prompt the message below, and stop asking for new guesses.

>Good Job! You guessed it!
>
>



# Design Choices

I have used the `random` from the Python library, because it is open source and part of the reuse strategy. It allows [`randrange()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange) to produce selections over an arbitrarily large range. `uniform` Return a random floating point number *N* such that `a <= N <= b` for `a <= b` and `b <= N <= a` for `b < a`.

```
from random import randrange, uniform
```



Generate random numbers with a range between 1 to 100.

```
RandomNo = randrange(1, 100)
```



I have defined counter for `Maxcount` for 10 loops which link with `Left` variable, so that it is used to count down in order to display the number of remaining tries.

```
# Initializing the number of guesses.
count = 0
MaxCount = 10
Left = MaxCount
while count < MaxCount:
	count += 1
	Left  -= 1
```



`UserInput` variable will get the user input in integer format.

```
UserInput = int(input("Enter guess what the target number is:- "))
```



The code below is for `If`, `else` statement for decision-making.

```
	if RandomNo == UserInput:
		print("Good Job! You guessed it!")
		# Once guessed, loop will break
		break
		
	elif RandomNo > UserInput:
		print("Oops, Your guess was LOW.")
		print("You have only left",Left,"Chances")
	elif RandomNo < UserInput:
		print("Oops, Your guess was HIGH.")
		print("You have only left",Left,"Chances")
```



If the maximum number of count >=10, the game will end and display the target number.

```
if count >= MaxCount:
	print("\nSorry, You didn't guess my number. It was %d" % RandomNo)
```

# Design Choices

`fmt` is a tool that automatically formats Go source code. `math/rand` is the library for to perform mathematical calculations and generate random numbers. `time`  provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.

```
import(
   "fmt"
   "math/rand"
   "time"
)
```



Generate random numbers with a range between 1 to 100.

```
func xrand(min, max int) int {
   rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
   return rand.Intn(max - min) + min
}

mynumber := xrand(1, 100)

```



I have defined counter for `attempts` for 10 loops which link with `left` variable, so that it is used to count down in order to display the number of remaining tries.

```

   fmt.Println("You guessed the number in %d tries\n", mynumber)
   attempts := 0
   left := 10
   var guess int
 
   fmt.Println("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")
```



`guess` variable will get the user input in integer format.

```
fmt.Scanf("%d", &guess)
```



Below code is for `If`, `else` statement for decision making.

```
if guess < mynumber {
         fmt.Println("Oops, Your guess was LOW.")
		 fmt.Println("You have only left", left, "Chances")
      } else if guess > mynumber {
         fmt.Println("Oops, Your guess was HIGH.")
		 fmt.Println("You have only left", left, "Chances")
      } else if guess == mynumber {
         break
      }
   }
   if guess == mynumber {
      fmt.Printf("Good Job! You guessed it!")
   } else {
      fmt.Printf("Sorry, You didn't guess my number. It was %d", mynumber)
   }
```
